This is conceptual conversion script for use with [EBStudio](http://ebstudio.info/home/EBStudio.html).
The required ```Gaiji.xml``` and ```GaijiMap.xml``` have to be created separately.

* ```entry_export_ebs.xslt``` the main conversion script.
* ```build-GaijiMap.rb``` helper script to build GaijiMap.xml file from converted html file.
